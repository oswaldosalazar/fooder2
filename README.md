How many times have you been out wondering what restaurant options are available?

This mobile-first web app combines the Tinder cards logic with a restaurants app. You will see a deck of cards showing open restaurants around your area. Swipe right to move them to a "Selected" list or left to discard them.

After going through the deck, open the menu and go to Selected and decide where to go easily!

This front-end app uses the following technologies:

* Material Design Lite (mobile-first responsive design)
* Angular 2
* Foursquare API
* Geolocation

I used the Tinder cards logic from this open source project:
